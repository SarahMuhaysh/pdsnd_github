### Project Title
Bike Share Project

### Description
In this project, I use Python to explore data and extract descriptive statistics related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington).
This project prompts the user to type the city name, select a month, and select a day of the week to filter the data.
Then, the project calculates some statistics according to the user entry.
This project is part of "Programming for Data Science" nanodegree requirements.
